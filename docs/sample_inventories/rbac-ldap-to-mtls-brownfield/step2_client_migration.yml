## The following is an example inventory file of the configuration required for setting up Confluent Platform with RBAC over LDAP. And then migrating to mTLS
## Principals extracted from certs and ldap credentials are given role bindings.
## Extra configs added to keep cp service to service communication over certs only and not use LDAP credentials there.
## External clients of kafka or other services can use LDAP credentials to communicate with the cluster
## Migrate Control Center from LDAP to SSO

####################### STEP 2 #######################
######################################################

# Have certificates ready for all CP clients(kafka and non kafka)
# Give the principals from cert appropriate role bindings

# Start sending certificates from all Clients of kafka and other CP components which are outside cp-ansible.
# Ensure that all of them are sending certificates. If any client is not sending certificates then we CANNOT move to STEP3
