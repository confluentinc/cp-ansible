##
## The following is an example inventory file for Migration of ZK cluster to Kraft cluster where your ZK is setup with SCRAM or SCRAM256.
## steps to run:
## 1. Run command "ansible-playbook -i <inv.yml> confluent.platform.all" to setup a ZK cluster
## 2. Once ZK cluster setup is complete, uncomment "kraft_migration: true" and kafka_controller section.
## 3. If your sasl_protocol is scram or scram256, uncomment the kafka_controller_sasl_protocol variable and set it to "plain". You can set it to 'kerberos' as well if needed after setting up kerberos server accordingly.
## 4. Run command "ansible-playbook -i <inv.yml> confluent.platform.ZKtoKraftMigration"
## 5. Once Kraft cluster is up and running, Remove "kraft_migration: true" and Zookeeper section from the inventory file.
