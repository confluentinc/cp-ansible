    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /tmp/certs/ssh_priv.pem

    #### Setting Proxy Environment variables ####
    ## To set proxy env vars for the duration of playbook run, uncomment below block and set as necessary
    # proxy_env:
    #   http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080
    #   https_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080
    ## Note: You must use Hostnames or IPs to define your no_proxy server addresses, CIDR ranges are not supported.
    #   no_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080

    #### SASL Authentication Configuration ####
    ## By default there will be no SASL Authentication
    ## For SASL/PLAIN uncomment this line:
    # sasl_protocol: plain
    ## For SASL/SCRAM uncomment this line:
    # sasl_protocol: scram
    ## For SASL/GSSAPI uncomment this line and see Kerberos Configuration properties below
    # sasl_protocol: kerberos

    #### Zookeeper SASL Authentication ####
    ## Zookeeper can have Kerberos (GSSAPI) or Digest-MD5 SASL Authentication
    ## By default when sasl_protocol = kerberos, zookeeper will also use sasl kerberos. It can  be configured with:
    ## When a mechanism is selected, zookeeper.set.acl=true is added to kafka's server.properties. Note: property not added when using mTLS, set manually with Custom Properties
    # zookeeper_sasl_protocol: <none/kerberos/digest>

    #### Kerberos Configuration ####
    ## Applicable when sasl_protocol is kerberos
    ## REQUIRED: Under each host set keytab file path and principal name, see below
    # kerberos_configure: <Boolean for ansible to install kerberos packages and configure this file: /etc/krb5.conf, defaults to true>
    # kerberos:
    #   realm: <KDC server realm eg. confluent.example.com>
    #   kdc_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>
    #   admin_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>

    #### TLS Configuration ####
    ## By default, data will NOT be encrypted. To turn on TLS encryption, uncomment this line
    # ssl_enabled: true
    ## By default, the components will be configured with One-Way TLS, to turn on TLS mutual auth, uncomment this line:
    # ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
    ## By default, the certs for this configuration will be self signed, to deploy custom certificates there are two options.
    ## Option 1: Custom Certs
    ## You will need to provide the path to the Certificate Authority Cert used to sign each hosts' certs
    ## As well as the signed certificate path and the key for that certificate for each host.
    ## These will need to be set for the correct host
    # ssl_custom_certs: true
    # ssl_custom_certs_remote_src: true # set to true if key crt and ca file already on hosts, file paths must still be set
    # ssl_ca_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/ca.crt" # Can be a bundle of ca certs to be included in truststore
    # ssl_signed_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-signed.crt" # Can be a full chain of certs
    # ssl_key_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-key.pem"
    # ssl_key_password: <password for key for each host, will be inputting in the form -passin pass:{{ssl_key_password}} >
    # regenerate_keystore_and_truststore: true # Set to true to update certs on hosts. If keystores/truststores exist, they won't be updated without this variable.
    ## Option 2: Custom Keystores and Truststores (either on control node or the component nodes)
    ## CP-Ansible can move keystores/truststores to their corresponding hosts and configure the components to use them. Set These vars
    # ssl_provided_keystore_and_truststore: true
    # ssl_keystore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-keystore.jks"
    # ssl_keystore_key_password: mystorepassword
    # ssl_keystore_store_password: mystorepassword
    # ssl_keystore_alias: <alias for host specific certificate, only required if multiple certs in provided keystore>
    # ssl_truststore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/truststore.jks"
    # ssl_truststore_password: truststorepass
    # ssl_truststore_ca_cert_alias: <alias to the ca certificate in the truststore eg. CARoot>
    ## Use this if you want to provide keystore/truststore already present on the host. Set the above vars for each component separately if this is enabled.
    # ssl_provided_keystore_and_truststore_remote_src: true

    #### Zookeeper TLS Configuration ####
    ## Zookeeper can also have TLS Encryption and mTLS Authentication
    ## Zookeeper's TLS settings are inherited from the ssl_enabled settings.
    ## If you have ssl_enabled, but want zookeeper without TLS, uncomment these lines
    # zookeeper_ssl_enabled: false
    # zookeeper_ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false

    #### Certificate Regeneration ####
    ## When using self signed certificates, each playbook run will regenerate the CA, to turn this off, uncomment this line:
    # regenerate_ca: false
    ## By default, the playbook will recreate them keystores and truststores on each run,
    ## To prevent this, uncomment this line:
    # regenerate_keystore_and_truststore: false

    #### Monitoring Configuration ####
    ## Jolokia is disabled by default. When enabled, Jolokia jar gets pulled from the internet and enabled on all the components
    ## To enable, uncomment this line:
    # jolokia_enabled: true
    ## To copy from control host instead of downloading from remote URL:
    # jolokia_url_remote: false
    ## During setup, the hosts will download the jolokia agent jar from Maven. To update that jar download set this var
    # jolokia_jar_url: http://<inteneral-server>/jolokia-jvm-1.6.2-agent.jar
    ## JMX Exporter is disabled by default. When enabled, JMX Exporter jar will be pulled from the Internet and enabled on the broker and zookeeper *only*.
    ## To enable, uncomment this line:
    # jmxexporter_enabled: true
    ## To update that jar download set this var
    # jmxexporter_jar_url: http://<internal-server>/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.12.0.jar
    ## To copy from control host instead of downloading from remote URL:
    # jmxexporter_url_remote: false

    #### Custom Yum Repo File (Rhel/Centos) ####
    ## If you are using your own yum repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # repository_configuration: custom
    # custom_yum_repofile_filepath: /tmp/my-repo.repo

    #### Custom Apt Repo File (Ubuntu/Debian) ####
    ## If you are using your own apt repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # repository_configuration: custom
    # custom_apt_repo_filepath: "/tmp/my-source.list"

    #### Confluent Server vs Confluent Kafka ####
    ## Confluent Server will be installed by default, to install confluent-kafka instead, uncomment the below
    # confluent_server_enabled: false

    #### Schema Validation ####
    ## Schema Validation with the kafka configuration is disabled by default. To enable uncomment this line:
    ## Schema Validation only works with confluent_server_enabled: true
    # kafka_broker_schema_validation_enabled: true

    #### Fips Security ####
    ## To enable Fips for added security, uncomment the below line.
    ## Fips only works with ssl_enabled: true and confluent_server_enabled: true
    # fips_enabled: true

    #### Configuring Multiple Listeners ####
    ## CP-Ansible will configure two listeners on the broker: a broker listener for the broker to communicate and an internal for the components and other clients.
    ## If you only need one listener uncomment this line:
    # kafka_broker_configure_multiple_listeners: false
    ## By default both of these listeners will follow whatever you set for ssl_enabled and sasl_protocol.
    ## To configure different security settings on the internal and external listeners set the following variables:
    # kafka_broker_custom_listeners:
    #   broker:
    #     name: BROKER
    #     port: 9091
    #     ssl_enabled: false
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: none
    #   internal:
    #     name: INTERNAL
    #     port: 9092
    #     ssl_enabled: true
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: scram
    ## You can even add additional listeners, make sure name and port are unique
    #   client_listener:
    #     name: CLIENT
    #     port: 9093
    #     ssl_enabled: true
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
    #     sasl_protocol: scram

    #### Creating Connectors ####
    ## To manage the connector configs from Ansible, set the following list of connector objects:
    ## one per connector, must have `name` and `config` properties
    ## make sure to provide the numeric values as strings
    # kafka_connect_connectors:
    #   - name: sample-connector
    #     config:
    #       connector.class: "org.apache.kafka.connect.tools.VerifiableSinkConnector"
    #       tasks.max: "1"
    #       file: "path/to/file.txt"
    #       topics: "test_topic"

    #### Configuring logredactor ####
    ## To configure logredactor for all components, set the following variables ##

    # # Something like ../../../rules.json
    # logredactor_rule_path: <path to rule file on component node>
    # logredactor_policy_refresh_interval: 7000

    #### Configuring Role Based Access Control ####
    ## To have CP-Ansible configure Components for RBAC and create necessary role bindings, set these mandatory variables:
    ## Note: Confluent components will be configured to connect to the "internal" listener automatically
    ## DO NOT UPDATE the internal listener
    ## Note: It is recommended to create an additional listener for external clients, but the interbroker listener would also work
    ## Note: An authentication mode must be selected on all listeners, for example (ssl_enabled=false and ssl_mutual_auth_enabled=false) or sasl_protocol=none is not supported.
    # rbac_enabled: true
    ##
    ## LDAP Users
    ## Note: Below users must already exist in your LDAP environment.  See kafka_broker vars, for LDAP connection details.

    #   sasl_protocol: none <set protocol for remote MDS, options are: kerberos, sasl_plain, sasl_scram>
    ##
    ## By default the Confluent CLI will be installed on each host *when rbac is enabled*, to stop this download set:
    # confluent_cli_download_enabled: false
    ## CLI will be downloaded from Confluent's webservers, to customize the location of the binary set:

## Note: There can only be one kafka_connect group, so comment out above section, if configuring multiple connect clusters
## Decide on a name for each connect cluster (that is not 'kafka_connect') and use that as ansible group name
# syslog:
#   vars:
#     # Decide on a group id for each connect cluster. This is a mandatory variable, and must be unique for each cluster
#     # The group id will be the name of the connect cluster within c3
