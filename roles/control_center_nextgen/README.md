## Introduction

Ansible provides a simple way to deploy, manage, and configure the Confluent Platform services.
This role confluent.control_center is used to deploy control center for Confluent Platform.
We don't recommend using this role explicitly, we'd rather suggest to use the playbook confluent.platform.all
