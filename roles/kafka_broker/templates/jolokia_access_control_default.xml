  Kafka Broker - Defense in Depth Security
  Strategy: Deny All Commands + Allow Specific MBeans
  1. Deny ALL Jolokia commands first (defense in depth)
  2. Allow only specific MBeans for monitoring
  3. Fine-grained attribute and operation control
-->
<restrict>
  <!-- ALLOW ONLY read command globally (blocks list, write, exec, search, notification, version) -->
  <commands>
  </commands>
